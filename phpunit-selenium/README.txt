This package contains a base Testcase Class that can be used to run end-to-end tests against Selenium 2 (using its Selenium 1 backward compatible Api).

To run the test suite for this package, you should serve selenium-1-tests via HTTP:
selenium-1-tests/ $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
and configure the constant that you will be asked for accordingly.
