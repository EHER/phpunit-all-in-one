# PHPLOC

`phploc` is a tool for quickly measuring the size and analyzing the structure of a PHP project.

## Installation

There a two supported ways of installing PHPLOC.

You can use the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php) to download and install PHPLOC as well as its dependencies. You can also download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) of PHPLOC that has all required dependencies of PHPLOC bundled in a single file.

### PEAR Installer

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPLOC using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/phploc

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

    wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phploc.phar
    chmod +x phploc.phar
